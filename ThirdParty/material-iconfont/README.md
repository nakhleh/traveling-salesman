Note:
This directory taken from the google material design icons project: https://github.com/google/material-design-icons
Taking the whole distribution is excessive, given only the need for the webfont, and can cause problems on Windows.

Original readme:
---------
The recommended way to use the Material Icons font is by linking to the web font hosted on Google Fonts:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"
      rel="stylesheet">
```
